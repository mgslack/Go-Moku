    <p>The game of Go-Moku is a game where players take turns and attempt to get five stones in a row.
	   For this game, the player always starts and usess the white (or cross) stones.  The computer uses
	   the black (or nought) stones at the beginning.  This version uses the old style 19x19 Go board
	   versus the modern 15x15 Go board.  Can select auto-play and have the computer play itself.</p>
    <p>When the game is started, a new game is automatically began.  The player can begin placing a stones
	   anywhere on the board, get a hint, switch sides with the computer or toggle auto-play on.  Once a
	   stone is placed (play stone), the computer will make its move.  If auto-play is toggled on at any
	   time, the computer will play out the game.  The moves continue between player and computer till one
	   gets five stones in a line (horizontal, vertical or diagonal).  If the game progresses till no one
	   can make a 'five in a row', the game is ended with a tie.</p>
	<p>There is a built in 'hint' function and if selected will move the highlight cursor to the
	   recommended stone placement.  This can be ignored and the stone placed elsewhere.  In addition,
	   there is a button that allows the player to switch places with the computer.  If selected,
	   the player becomes the black (nought) stones while the computer plays out the white (cross)
	   stones.  If selected, the computer will play the players turn, then the player will play again.
	   This option can be selected at the beginning of the game before any stone is placed to allow
	   the computer to start the game.  If selected twice, the player is back to being the white
	   (cross) stones.</p>
	<p>Game can be played with the keyboard or mouse.  To select a place in the board to set a stone,
	   click on location with mouse.  Highlight cursor will move to that location.  Can use the 
	   keypad to move the highlight cursor around if wanted.  To play a stone, select the 'Play Stone'
	   button, or if button is highlighted (should be most of the time), select space or enter to play
	   the stone in the highlighted square.</p>
	<p>This game is based on a game in Turbo Pascal released with the Borland Turbo Gameworks toolbox
	   in 1987.  There are slight differences in game play, mainly the game was converted to play in
	   a C# windows form.  In addition, added a function to review the moves made in a game, as the
	   game is played or at the end.  As a nod to the original, the about box and the image in this
	   help page is a screen shot of the original game in operation.</p>

    <p>There are no options to set or configure for this game of Go-Moku.  The game does save off
	   the main window position when exiting the program.</p>
