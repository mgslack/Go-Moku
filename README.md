# Go-Moku
The classic Japanese game of 'five in a row'.

Game based on game released with the Borland Gameworks toolbox in 1987.  Modified for Windows and
converted to a C# forms application.  Has hint feature, function to 'switch sides' and auto-play.
Game is similar to the orginal in that it uses a 19 x 19 Go board versus a 15 x 15 Go board used in
current play.

Application is reliant on the Game Statistics and Custom MessageBox assembly's and needs both to
rebuild/compile the source.  Created using VS 2019.
